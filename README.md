## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to scale a large image file to fit its parent container and style it.

```css
.img {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    height: 60%;
    border-radius: 8%;
}
```
Also, I learnt how to align items vertically and horizontally using margin property, then, create spacing using padding property.

```css
.card {
    margin: 4em auto;
    padding: 15px 15px 32px 15px;
}
```
### Continued development

- Building responsive layouts.
- Learn the concept of mobile-first workflow.
